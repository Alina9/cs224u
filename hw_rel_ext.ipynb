    "- Experiment with features based on the context outside (rather than between) the two entity mentions âÂ that is, the words before the first mention, or after the second.\n",
    "- Try adding features which capture syntactic information, such as the dependency-path features used by Mintz et al. 2009. The [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) toolkit contains a variety of [parsing algorithms](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.parse.html) that may help.\n",
